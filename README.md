# testproject

I cloned an existing Git repository

Next, I navigated into the repository and then proceeded to configure the name and email

After this, I uploaded a text file into the repository and then ran 'git status' to check the status of the repository

Next I staged the changes and then commited them. After this, I pushed it to the remote repository

Later on, I created branches and then navigated between them

Next, I added a python file to the directory and pushed it to a particular branch

Finally, I used 'git log' to view the commit history
